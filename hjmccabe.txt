I am a big fan of doing crossword puzzles. I have a subscription to the New York Times crosswords and I try to complete them every day (when I have time).
Generally, I am only good enough to complete a Monday or Tuesday puzzle with any sort of consistency.
However, I am okay with that and I am getting better every week.
